# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## About

This is a project on: 
* Different sorting algorithms
* Big O notation and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* A stable sorting algorithm

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* gcc 9.2.0

## File Descriptions

**sort.h** - header file containing the prototypes of almost all functions and the definition of type listint_t.

**print_array.c** - function that prints an array.

**print_list.c** - function that prints a list.

## Mandatory

**0-bubble_sort.c** - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

**0-O** - time complexities for the bubble sort algorithm in the best, average, and worst case scenarios.

**1-insertion_sort_list.c** - function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.

**1-O** - time complexities for the insertion sort algorithm in the best, average, and worst case scenarios.

**2-selection_sort.c** - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.

**2-O** - time complexities for the selection sort algorithm in the best, average, and worst case scenarios.

**3-quick_sort.c** - function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the quick sort algorithm with the Lomuto partition scheme.

**3-O** - time complexities for the quick sort algorithm with the Lomuto partition scheme in the best, average, and worst case scenarios.
